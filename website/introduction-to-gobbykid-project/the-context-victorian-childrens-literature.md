# The context: Victorian children’s literature

A brief disclaimer about the subject of inquiry seems to be necessary in order to avoid any kind of misconception.&#x20;

For Victorian Children’s Literature we intend the body of books for children written by authors from the United Kingdom (at the time, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) during the Victorian Era, which is understood as:

> the period between approximately 1820 and 1914, corresponding roughly but not exactly to the period of Queen Victoria’s reign (1837–1901) and characterized by a class-based society, a growing number of people able to vote, a growing state and economy, and Britain’s status as the most powerful empire in the world [(Encyclopedia Britannica 2022)](../references-tools-and-team/references.md#web-resources).

Towards the end of the 19th century, children’s literature became a detached genre with its own shape and distinctiveness. The consequences of this process of definition were both literary and social, such as:

> the adoption of the fairy tale as a fashionable Victorian genre \[and] the romantic idealization of childhood and its literature \[that] brought child-study to the forefront of scholarly and popular interests [(Lundin 1994, 54)](../references-tools-and-team/references.md#bibliography).

Starting from these assumptions, it is clear how children’s literature assumed a significant role in the Victorian society. Of great importance is clearly the fact that children’s literature represents one of the main sources of social and cultural norms and values. It is here where children faced the main issues of the societal life before becoming part of it. It is here where concepts, perspectives towards the outer world, and the perception of oneself role in the society were shaped.

Under a feminist perspective, the end of the 19th century appears to be very significant. English society saw the emergence of a new figure: the **New Woman**, who “had manifested herself in multifarious guises in fiction and in the periodical press throughout the 1880s and 1890s” [(Ledger 1997, 2)](../references-tools-and-team/references.md#bibliography). The emergence of this modern figure would have an undeniable influence in the development of a different perception of women in society during the 20th century, while during the 19th century it remained a rather **literary phenomenon**. However, the New Woman should not be though as a figure completely relatable to the late 20th century feminism ideal of woman:

> on the one hand she was regarded as sexually transgressive, as heavily implicated in social politics, and as a force of change; on the other hand New Woman writers of the fin de siècle were usually (although not always) stalwart supporters of heterosexual marriage, they had little or no conception of female sexual desire (let alone lesbian sexual desire), and often had a considerable investment in eugenic and other imperialist discourses [(Ledger 1997, 6)](../references-tools-and-team/references.md#bibliography).

During the same century, however, children’s literature was subjected to an increasing differentiation in relation with the audience’s gender. Anne H. Lundin perfectly explains how:

> the decades of the 1880s and 1890s displayed a growing consciousness of gender and a more rigid classification of children's books. Reflecting the broader discourse on gender roles, children's books during this period often dealt with themes of the "test of manhood" or "true womanhood." While books for the youngest readers tended to be more gender-inclusive, those for older children divided largely into adventure fiction for boys and domestic chronicles for girls [(Lundin 1994, 43)](../references-tools-and-team/references.md#bibliography).

This difference was not due to chance, but related to common publication procedures. In fact:

> Given the Victorian practice of serializing new literature before publishing it in entirety as a complete volume, the vast array of girls and boys magazines available to the young Victorian reader by the last decades of the nineteenth century indicates the new interest in producing gender-specific literature” [(Victorian Web, 2007)](../references-tools-and-team/references.md#web-resources).

Another difference seems to lie in the length of the tales:

> \[while] girls’ tales take the form of hefty tomes in keeping with the Victorian cult of feminine domesticity, since girls after all had much more time to read at home \[…], boys' tales are much shorter and gripping, suited for active British youths who had to divide their time between school and sports” [(Victorian Web, 2007)](../references-tools-and-team/references.md#web-resources).

Finally, what seems to be the another difference related to the audience’s gender is the number of published books for boys and for girls. Moreover, a peculiar feature is also the fact that Victorian children’s books are decidedly slanted toward boys' interests also in terms of the gender of the characters that populate the texts [(Lundin 1994, 44)](../references-tools-and-team/references.md#bibliography).

In summary, the situation is complicated and multifaceted. Whereas the modern and, in relation with the era, transgressive figure of more independent and involved women raised, these values and perspectives seem not to be reflected in Victorian children’s literature. Here, gender division appear to be growing not only in terms of fiction’s topic, but also in terms of formats and purposes.
