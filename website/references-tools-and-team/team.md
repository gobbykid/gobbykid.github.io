# Team

The whole project has been a process of strict collaboration and of exchanging of ideas.

We found it important to work together at the other sections in order to have a clearer view over both the context of Victorian Children's Literature and the theoretical background and assumptions. Research questions and conclusions have also been developed under a strict collaboration.

Finally, we would like to underlie that it has been decided to describe as much as possible the workflow and the functioning of the Python scripts in the most comprehensible way possible, with the aim of making the process as transparent as possible.
