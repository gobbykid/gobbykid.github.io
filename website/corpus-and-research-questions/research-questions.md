# Research questions

As highlighted in the [introductory section](../introduction-to-gobbykid-project/the-context-victorian-childrens-literature.md), the emergence of the figure of the “New Woman” during the last decades of the 19th century has determined a turning point in the conception of women's role in society. For this reason, some of our analyses investigate whether there are significant differences in books published before and after 1880.

### 1. Representation of the different genders across the corpus

Is it possible to affirm with certainty that there exists a significant difference in the way each gender is represented, from both the qualitative and quantitative perspective? Are these differences somehow related to the author's sex?&#x20;

### 2. Semantic context of gendered elements

What semantic features characterize the context in which gendered elements occur within the books? Is it possible to identify, starting from these features, any gender stereotype? If so, is there a correlation between these stereotypes and the authors' sex?

### 3. 1880 as a significant threshold

Considered the above questions, is it possible to find any sign of evolution throughout the Victorian Era? If so, is there enough evidence to consider 1880s a reliable indicator of change, with regard to the representation of gender related issues?&#x20;

All the different analyses we performed contribute in various ways and to different extent to either find answers to the above questions or evidence suggesting interesting paths for further research.
