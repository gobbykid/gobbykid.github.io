# Conclusions

### 1. Representation of the different genders across the corpus

From the perspective of the quantitative analysis of characters, the majority of books are populated by male characters. In particular, it seems that a significant difference exists in the way in which male and female authors choose their characters with respect to their gender. The prevalence of books with a majority of male representation is near to the 100% in the male corpus, while the situation in definitively more balanced in the corpus of female writers. From the point of view of the number of characters used b male and female authors, the situation varies, but not radically. Male characters are more than females one in both the sub-corpora, however, the representativeness of female characters in the female corpus doubles its score if compared with the one of the corpus of male writers. \
Therefore, we can assume that male and female characters differences in representation are strongly related to the gender of the authors they were created by.

To some extent, by the point of view of the simple raw percentages, it is possible to see that male authors tend toward the overrepresentation of male characters in their books. In particular, they seem to strengthen their role in society by providing an overall greater number of sentences “dedicated” to them. \
On the contrary, female authors seem to represent in majority male gender, in particular re-proposing the same configuration that saw male's gender as preponderant in society. This result is true only for the period before the 1880, then the situation changes a lot, in particular for women (for reference look at the third research question's answer).\
Thus, the representation of a particular gender inside a book seems connected, by the point of view of gendered sentences, to the sex of the author, but even societal views seem to play an important role, as we will see later.&#x20;

### 2. Semantic context of gendered elements

For what is connected with the semantic context in which female's gender seem to appear inside the corpora, we can easily see how women are connected with words that belong to the semantic field of love, and/or beauty, by the point of view of both male and female authors.\
A significant difference to notice is between the different places to which females or males all inked. In particular, our analyses of common words and word embeddings seem to suggest that men appear inside places somehow connected with education (such as universities, schools, etc.), differently from women. Moreover, a clear difference exists between the social relations that such analyses seem to suggest for females and males: while men seem to have  friends, or mentors, females are strictly connected with family members.\
Therefore, our results highlight that such texts seem to be biased for what concerns gender's roles and perspectives.

As regard to the topic model analysis of the corpus, it shows that gendered words like “_men_” or “_ladies_” are in some cases associated to themes and motifs that we would expect to be attributed to either of the genders; nonetheless, there are also associations that seem to contrast with more obvious stereotypes.

### 3. 1880 as a significant threshold

Time seems to affect our corpus in a manifold way with respect to the characters' gender representativeness. The most relevant changes are related to the sub-corpus of female authors. For what concerns the number of books by gender prevalence, the male corpus changes toward a more unbalance situation, where male prevalence changes from 89% to 98% before and after 1880. The female corpus experience a change in the contrary direction and reaches the perfect balance between male and female prevalence after 1880 coming from a disparity of approximately 30%.\
For what concerns characters number by gender, the situation seems quite clear. The male corpus do not experience substantial changes through the decades, while in the corpus of female authors a clear trend is visible. Here, the number of female characters by decade grows constantly until overtaking the number of male characters in the different last decades under analysis.\
The general post 1880 female writers' corpus shows a situation of 1% disparity, where male characters are still the most. On the contrary, the pre-1880 one shows a difference of almost 26%.\
On the other hand, curiously, the number of characters with male prevalence experienced a 10% growth after 1880. &#x20;

Thus, it can be argued that 1880 is quite a significant threshold, but only to some extents. It is relevant but only for what concerns the corpus of female writers in the case of the characters number by authors of different gender. Nevertheless, it should be considered that, despite the significant increase, the number of female characters did not skyrocket after 1880, and that the growing trend already started some decades before. On the number of books by gender prevalence, the differences are evident: books authored by women whose characters are prevalent females grew significantly after 1880 if compared with the ones with a male prevalence.

By the point of view of the different analyses performed, a change has indeed occurred in what regards the representation of male and female genders in society. In particular, it's pretty clear how women tend to represent themselves much more inside their sentences, with proportions from the 39% of representation before the 1880, to a strong 57%. Thus, _female authors started, after the 1880, to be much more present than men in the texts they wrote_.\
Moreover, it's also clear how women seem to evoke more trust in themselves after the 1880: they represent themselves in a slightly less positive connotation for what concerns overall emotional scores, but it is also clear how they represent themselves as less frightened and more happy.

The situation is instead pretty different for male authors. They represent women even less in their texts after the 1880 (from a 22% to a 17% overall number of female gendered sentences) and, when present, females seem to be more frightened and angry, as well as less joyful and trustworthy. The positive connotation that men tended to attribute to women before the threshold completely disappear after the emergence of the “new woman”, who seems to suggest, from the male perspective, a much more negative connotation and a higher arousal of fear and anger.

We have not detected any significant change in the topic distributions that might be correlated to the publication date of the works: _the social changes in the 1880s are not reflected in the topics emerging from the corpus_.
