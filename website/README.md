# An introductory overview of the project

During the Victorian era, the United Kingdom experienced a sharp increase in wealth, a significant growth in terms of culture’s richness, a high degree of industrialization, and a substantial political stability. However, this kind of society would still be faced with contradictions. Contrary to its often perceived wealthy connotation, the working-class was prevalent in the population. Gender and class were important factors in determining societal organization, and a sexual double standard pervaded the society. Victorian gender ideology can be summarized with the “**doctrine of the separate spheres**”, according to which, men and women were thought to be different and meant for different things, especially in terms of independence and societal participation. In spite of this, most working-class families could not live out the doctrine of separate spheres, because they could not survive on a single male wage [(Encyclopedia Britannica 2022)](references-tools-and-team/references.md#web-resources). Moreover, at the end of the 19th century, a new awareness of the role and participation of women in society seemed to emerge, and a feminist movement started to take shape.

_**Is it possible to find signs of these dynamic societal changes in the literature of that period, and in particular in children's literature, where all basic conceptions of the world as well as driving societal values are conveyed during the youngsters' educational phase?**_

This project has been developed in the framework of the “[Digital Text in the Humanities: Theories, Methodologies and Applications](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2022/424631)” held by the professor Tiziana Mancinelli for the master’s degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge of the University of Bologna.

The aim of this work is to highlight how gender related issues are treated in Victorian Children’s Literature by analyzing a corpus of books from that period by means of distant reading methods. We propose an analysis that could be considered complementary to the ones already realized with close reading and more qualitative methods of inquiry. Our research fits within the category of computer-based studies that:

> can provide concrete evidence to support or refute hypotheses or interpretations which have in the past been based on human reading and the somewhat serendipitous noting of interesting features [(Hockey 2000, 66)](references-tools-and-team/references.md#bibliography).

Our research aims to determine whether the main findings of studies that rely on human reading are reflected in the corpus we are investigating. However, some space has also been dedicated to topics that we did not encounter in previous studies, and to which corpus-based analyses can help in highlighting features. Under this perspective, the relationship with the corpus becomes crucial. Said with Franco Moretti’s words, "the trouble with close reading \[…] is that it necessarily depends on an extremely small canon" [(Moretti 2013, 48)](references-tools-and-team/references.md#bibliography). Here lies the main difference with close reading methods that allow us to think about this project as a test for the knowledge generated from previous studies: we inspect a large number of books instead of reading only a bunch of them, and we exploit distant reading as a mean for “focus\[ing] on units that are much smaller or much larger than the text” [(Moretti 2013, 48-49)](references-tools-and-team/references.md#bibliography).
