# Counting characters in the corpus

Despite the two analyses seem to be similar, this inquiry should not be confused with the previous one. While in the past investigation we compared the percentages of **books** in which different genders were prevalent, here we deal directly with **characters.**

The differences in the sub-corpora of male and female authors are directly depicted here. The pie charts show once more what we would have expected after having looked at the previous section of the project. However, the values are completely different. Another category is also introduced here: “Gender n.a.” represents the percentage of characters our gender recognition process was not able to classify for a given corpus.

The characters in the corpus of male authors are mainly males. Their amount reaches the 68%, where females are less than a third of them. Also in this case, the situation in the female authors' corpus shows that male characters are still prevalent, but this time only with the 8.8% of deviation.

The variation in the corpus of male authors before and after 1880 is not so evident. In fact, the approximately 2% decrease in male characters corresponds to an increase of the characters we were not able to classify. The presence of female characters, on the contrary, seem to be stable around the 22%. The two illustrations do not show anything special with respect to the previous group of charts, which can be considered representative for the both sub-periods.

Dissimilar is the scenery proposed by the corpus of female authors. Firstly, the characters without an assigned gender are way more stable across the periods. Moreover, the presence of male and female characters evolved towards a semi-accomplished balance. Before 1880 female inhabited only the 34% percent of the books written by women, whereas male ones  were the 60.1%. This representation can be considered similar to the one of the male authors' corpus of the same period, despite the 9% deviation. However, differently from what happened in the other sub-corpus, after 1880 the percentage of female characters experienced a substantial growth. These last category became only about 1% less numerous than the one of male characters.

In conclusion, in spite of the more or less constant behavior of the characters' gender representation in the corpus of male writers, the one of female writers saw a positive trend for what concern the presence of female characters.
