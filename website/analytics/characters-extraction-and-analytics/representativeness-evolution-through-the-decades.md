# Representativeness evolution through the decades

Given the results derived from the previous analyses, we thought that it would have been relevant to deepen how the variation found in the period-based sub-corpora spread throughout time. For this reason, the number of male and female characters present in books have been grouped by decades and plotted in this section.

An overview on the full corpus let notice how the presence of female characters grew over time. Nevertheless, the percentages are always lower than the ones of the male characters, which are constantly more than the double until 1890. The decade with the highest number of female characters was the 1900-1909 one, when female characters were almost the 43%.

In the corpus of male authors, male characters are always the most numerous and, in general, they were subjected to a slight decrease during the 1840s and the 1880s. The decade 1840-1849 is also the one in which female characters reached a percentage higher than 26%.

Also in this context, the corpus of female authors is characterized by a very different conformation. In particular, it is possible to see that female characters are more represented than male ones in both the last two decades of our analysis. In the ten years between 1900 and 1909, female characters are about 6% more than male characters, while in the subsequent decade they are approximately the 3.5% more. Furthermore, this is not the only relevant insight. The increasing number of female characters is a trend that seems not to begin in the 1880s, but in the 1950s, when, however, the proportion of female characters with respect with male ones was still less than a half.

In conclusion, the area-charts seem to confirm how the main trend in the male corpus is more or less stable, and that time did not affect the choice of characters' gender. On the contrary, the deviation between the number of male and female characters in the corpus of female authors decreased stably through time, until female characters became more numerous than male ones.
