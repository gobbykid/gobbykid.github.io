# Books by characters' gender prevalence

A first analysis aims at pointing out the difference in the quantity of books whose characters are mainly males, females, or where the two are perfectly balanced.

At a first glance, it seems that the greatest part of the books in the corpus is mainly populated by male characters. In fact, the first set of charts depicts how male characters prevail in more than two-thirds of the books of the full corpus (68.4%), against which texts with female prevalence are less than a half (25.2%). There is also a small portion of texts, the 6.39%, where the two genders are equally represented in the characters' selection.

However, the situation is radically different by splitting the whole corpus in two sub-corpora: one for the male and one for the female authors. While male fictional character are in the majority in more than 95% of the books written by men, the configuration of the corpus of female writers presents a more balanced condition. Here, female characters prevail in more than the 41% of the books. Nevertheless, the amount of books in which the presence of males is more evident is still higher: it reaches the 49.7%.

According to these plots, the preponderance of books with a prevalence of males in the pre-splitting-corpus seems to be primarily caused by the texts written by men.

Another interesting phenomenon can be appreciated by splitting each of the already existent sub-corpora in other two sub-corpora: one for the books whose publication occurred before 1880 and one for the ones published after 1880.

Whereas in the male corpus we assist to a 10% increase of the books with a majority of male characters after 1880, male characters-based books drastically decrease in number in the female corpus. In the former corpus, in fact, the already low percentage of books with a prevalence of female representation before 1880 decreases until reaching 1.37% after this date. The number of texts in which gender representation is balanced between characters also diminishes after 1880. More precisely, there is no book at all that presents this situation.

The counter-trend illustrated by the pie charts of the female writers' corpus is highlighted by the perfectly balanced percentages of books in which either males or females prevail after 1880. The state of affairs before the temporal threshold, however, were not the same. In fact, the books in which female characters prevailed were approximately the 30% less than the ones where male character were the most numerous (30.2% and 60% respectively). &#x20;

Differently from the previous cases, the relative quantity of balanced books did not experience a great change of magnitude before and after 1880.

In conclusion, the division of the sub-corpora in periods brings to the foreground an important difference. The 10% augment of books with a male prevalence in them in the corpus of male writers corresponds to a growth of approximately 15% in the presence of books with female prevalence in the corpus of female writers.
