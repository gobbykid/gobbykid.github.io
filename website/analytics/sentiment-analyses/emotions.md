# Emotions

### Emotional scores: a world of joy and fear

As can be seen in the chart below, the kinds of emotion that different authors arouse in their texts (according to our code) are approximately similar, even thought with some differences that seem to emerge in particular within different genders of the authors.

In fact, female authors seem to be slightly more positive than male authors in general: their texts present more _joy_ with respect to the male counterpart. Males tends instead to express much more anger and fear with respect to females, they seem to reflect a more negative view in their texts, or at least to address more negative issues.

The discussion related to the emotional scores proceeds in this section. We will briefly analyze whether there are differences before and after 1880 for both genders.

### The new woman: frightened and angry&#x20;

By looking at the plot below, seems like that both females and males were used to present female characters with a more positive connotation. Females seems to evoke emotions relative to positivity both when described by males and females. The only difference that we can spot is relative to a male view of women (females in general) more frightened than what female authors seems to suggest.&#x20;

The situation seems to be slightly different also for male sentences. We can see that, in general, male authors tend to associate their sex with emotions more negative than positive.

The situation seems to change after the year 1880, that in literature is set as a threshold. In particular, we can see that male authors arouse more negative emotions around the female figure: women seem to be more _frightened_ (or _scary_) and to express more _anger_ than what they were used to do before 1880, the _trust_ placed in them has diminished, as well as the _joy_.&#x20;

On the contrary, female authors seem to strengthen the position of women in literature by connecting them with an overall higher set of positive emotions, in particular if compared to male view of females.

#### Let's go deeper

We want to go deeper in this analysis by looking at the differences that the 1880 threshold has set. In order to do that, we can simply look at the changes that took place after the emergence of the "new woman".

Starting from female authors, we can clearly see that their view of gender related emotional issues slightly changed for specific genders but changed in its overall expression by providing a sort of more _enthusiastic set of texts_. Seems like that their general view propose angry men who express fear (or feel scared, we would need many more analysis to disambiguate here) both before and after 1880, but such emotions tend to decrease once passed the threshold.

Once passed the 1880, men seem to express an overall set of more negative emotions around the female figure but, the same change can be found in their view of men, even though with a less decrease with respect to the decrease that has been found for female sentences (with _decrease_ we mean, on a scale from negative to positive emotions, that the related overall positivity has decreased).
