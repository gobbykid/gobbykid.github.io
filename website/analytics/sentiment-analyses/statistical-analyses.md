  In this section it is possible to find the results for the statistical
  analysis of sentiment scores, divided in pre and post 1880. Together with
  that, you will find a comparative analysis of corpora.

# Statistical analyses

### Literature for youngsters: lovely places and lovely people

The results of our analysis do not provide any statistically significant difference between the way in which female and male authors presents their female and male characters.

There is a general majority of positive connotations, with respect to negative ones, of sentences.&#x20;

These results do not provide any particular evidence of a possible change in the trend after the year 1880, in fact the situation seems mostly similar even once passed the threshold.

Just to be sure about this "stagnant situation", we will try to perform a comparative analysis of corpora but between equal gender scores, in order to obtain a final output that can possibly give some kind of overview of the gender perception during the Victorian era.

### Comparative analysis of gender perception

In this paragraph, we will briefly present the results obtained by performing a comparative analysis of gender perception in between corpora. Such analysis is based on the sentiment scores of sentences: we decided to compare female and male perception of genders before and after the year 1880. One possibility was to find evidences to support the idea of a "positive reinterpretation of female gender" after the year 1880.

The task failed in its scope: we did not find any statistically significant evidence of such change in the conception (and presentation) of female gendered sentences.

#### Could Pollyhanna explain our results?

By looking at the studies conducted by Boucher and Osgood ([Boucher and Osgood 1969](../../references-tools-and-team/references.md)), we can say that “people tend to look on, and talk about, the bright side of life”, namely the _<mark style="color:red;">Pollyanna hypothesis</mark>_. That is to say that in general, humans tend to use positive words more frequently, with respect to negative ones, for evaluation tasks.

Such kind of studies could explain our results, and bring to the surface a general tendency that does not make easy to evaluate sentimental connotations in order to express the idea of an author about some particular aspects that he/she expresses in his/her text.

With such idea in mind, could be interesting to reproduce our statistical analysis but trying to balance the results with the Pollyhanna effect in mind. Some kind of "normalization measure" has to be developed to this aim.

### Emotions over connotations?

We could try to dive deeper inside the sentiment scores of sentences by analyzing also the different emetions related with the texts of our corpora.
