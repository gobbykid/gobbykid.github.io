# Raw scores

### Raw count of gendered sentences

As it is possible to see in the charts presented above, for texts written before the year 1880 we have a clear majority of male gendered sentences with respect to female ones.&#x20;

These observations could be translated into a tendency towards the idea of a "male figure" at the center of society. Even female authors seem to respect and repeat such structure.

The situation changes towards the end of the century. During these years seems that women start to write more about themselves and to put their figure before the male one. In the meantime, male authors confirm and even strengthen their role in society by giving a stronger importance to their figure even in children's literature.

It is thus possible to infer that, in general, men tend towards the repetition and the confirmation of their role in society? The Victorian era doesn't seem to have influenced their perception of gender roles. Instead, for what concerns females, we could try to explain the results obtained by looking at the societal changes around female roles that took place in this period and, by giving as a possible assumption, their greater awareness of female roles in society and of gender related issues.

### Raw sentiment scores of gendered sentences

For what concerns these data, we cannot see any difference in simple classified sentences. In fact, seems that before, as well as after 1880, authors do not change the _"quality of sentiments"_ that they seem to arouse in their texts.

Moreover, the situation seems to be pretty similar even within different genders perceptions. In fact, it is possible to see that the proportions do not change neither for positive and negative sentences related to male and female classified sentences inside each individual corpus, neither when sentences contained in different corpora are compared.&#x20;

This tendency could be explained by thinking about the fact that such books are nothing more than literature for youngsters so, sentences could tend to be more positive than negative, and to transmit an overall positive message. Moreover, these results could also be based on the Pollyhanna effect, that we will introduce [later](statistical-analyses.md).
